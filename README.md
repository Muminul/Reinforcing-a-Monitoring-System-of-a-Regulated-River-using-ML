# Reinforcing-a-Monitoring-System-of-a-Regulated-River-using-ML
Traditional flood prediction methods, such as rain forecast and satellite cloud imaging, have low prediction accuracy and only provide short-term early warnings.
As a result, they do not give authorities enough preparation time.
To address these limitations, we developed a multilevel intelligent flood forecast model using a combination of multi recurrent neural network (RNN) and regression models.
Through comparisons with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), and dual-cycle LSTM (BiLSTM) models, we selected the BiLSTM model as the prediction module due to its higher accuracy and lower data loss.
